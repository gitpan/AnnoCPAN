<h2>Site Policies</h2>

<h3>Privacy policy</h3>

<p>The information that you provide to this site, such as email addresses,
won't be published or shared with anyone without your consent (except by
judicial order). Other than that, the only information collected is the IP
address used to post each note, but IP addresses won't be published either.
Cookies are used for authentication purposes only.

<h3>License</h3>

<p>By posting a note in this site, you agree that it may be used, modified, and
redistributed under the same terms as Perl itself. This is to make sure that
other sites can use the notes and so that they may be included as part of the
documentation for a module if the maintainer of the module wishes.

<h3>Moderation</h3>

<p>Notes that are blatantly irrelevant or flaming may be edited or deleted.
Spam will be deleted and spammers will be banned. For cleanup purposes, notes
may also be hidden or moved for versions other than the version to which they
were originally posted, when they are no longer relevant or the automagic
algorithm assigned them to the wrong paragraph.
