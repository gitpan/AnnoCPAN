AnnoCPAN development version 0.22
=================================

AnnoCPAN is a web interface for the documentation of all the modules on CPAN,
where users can add annotations on the margin of specific paragraphs throughout
the POD.

INSTALLATION

1) First, the usual (after satisfying the dependencies):

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

2) Copy, move, or link the html/ directory, and/or configure your server
   so that html/ directory is in your server's webspace.

3) Put the tt/ directory somewhere readable by the web server (but not in the
   webspace).

4) Edit config.pl to set the database and other details, and possibly
   html/index.cgi so that it can find the config file.

5) Create the tables. Assuming you have a mysql database called annocpan,

    mysql annocpan < tables.mysql

6) Load the database (you need a local CPAN mirror). It may take a while...

    annocpan_load /path/to/local/mirror/of/CPAN
